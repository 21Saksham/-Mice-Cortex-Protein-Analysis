# Mice Cortex Protein Analysis
## Project Overview
This project analyzes protein expression levels in the cerebral cortex of mice to classify them based on genotype, behavior, and treatment. The aim is to identify key proteins and understand biological mechanisms related to learning and memory in the context of Down syndrome.

## Problem Statement
Classification: Classify mice into categories based on genotype, behavior, and treatment.
Protein Identification: Identify proteins that discriminate between these categories.
Biological Insight: Explore learning and memory mechanisms, particularly in Down syndrome.
# Steps Involved
## Data Preprocessing
Handling Missing Values: Impute missing data using mean/median or KNN.
Normalization/Scaling: Standardize protein expression levels with Min-Max scaling or Z-score normalization.
Encoding Categorical Variables: Convert categorical data to numerical format using one-hot or label encoding.
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Summary Statistics: Calculate mean, median, and standard deviation for each protein.
Visualizations: Create histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to analyze data distribution and relationships.
## Feature Selection
Correlation Analysis: Remove redundant features by examining correlations.
Mutual Information: Identify informative features for classification.
Model-Based Selection: Use feature importance from models to select key features.
## Model Training
Data Splitting: Divide data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
Model Selection: Experiment with models like Random Forest, SVM, and Neural Networks.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize models using Grid or Random Search.
## Model Evaluation
Metrics: Evaluate models with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Confusion Matrix: Visualize performance to understand true/false positives and negatives.
## Results Interpretation
Key Proteins: Identify proteins crucial for classification.
Biological Context: Discuss how findings relate to Down syndrome and learning mechanisms.
